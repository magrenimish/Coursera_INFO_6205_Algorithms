# Algorithm Analysis

### Module 1: Introduction to Algorithm Analysis
- **Video Lecture**: Introduction to computational tractability, asymptotic order of growth, and a survey of common running times.
- **Exercise**: Basic exercises on identifying algorithm efficiency and growth rates.
- **Programming Problem**: Implement a simple algorithm and analyze its time complexity.

### Module 2: Understanding Complexity Classes
- **Video Lecture**: Deep dive into polynomial and exponential time complexities.
- **Exercise**: Classify algorithms based on their complexities.
- **Programming Problem**: Write algorithms with specified time complexities (e.g., polynomial time) and demonstrate their efficiency.

### Module 3: Big-Oh, Big-Omega, and Big-Theta Notations
- **Video Lecture**: Explanation of asymptotic notations and their significance in algorithm analysis.
- **Exercise**: Solve problems on calculating big-Oh, big-Omega, and big-Theta for given functions.
- **Programming Problem**: Analyze given code snippets and assign the correct asymptotic notation.

### Module 4: Advanced Algorithm Analysis Techniques
- **Video Lecture**: Exploring worst-case, average-case, and amortized analysis.
- **Exercise**: Practical exercises on determining the most appropriate analysis technique for various algorithms.
- **Programming Problem**: Modify an existing algorithm to improve its worst-case runtime efficiency.

### Module 5: Practical Applications of Algorithm Analysis
- **Video Lecture**: Case studies on the application of algorithm analysis to optimize real-world problems.
- **Exercise**: Analyze the efficiency of algorithms used in common applications (e.g., sorting, searching).
- **Programming Problem**: Optimize a provided inefficient algorithm based on analysis techniques learned.

### Module 6: Challenges and Limitations
