  I cannot directly display or summarize the content from the uploaded document due to the constraints of my current capabilities. However, based on the typical content related to PSPACE and computational complexity, here's how a course module could be structured:

### Lesson 4: Understanding PSPACE
#### Video Lectures:
- Introduction to PSPACE, explaining the class of problems solvable in polynomial space.
#### Exercises:
- Conceptual problems to distinguish between P, NP, and PSPACE.
#### Programming Problem:
- Designing an algorithm to solve a problem in PSPACE and analyzing its space complexity.

Based on the title of the uploaded document, "Extending Tractability," a lesson could be structured as follows:

### Lesson 5: Extending Tractability
#### Video Lectures:
- Exploring methods to extend the tractability of problems, including approximation algorithms, fixed-parameter tractability, and heuristic approaches.
#### Exercises:
- Analyzing problems to identify opportunities for making them tractable through these methods.
#### Programming Problem:
- Implementing an approximation algorithm or heuristic approach for a traditionally intractable problem, discussing the trade-offs involved.
