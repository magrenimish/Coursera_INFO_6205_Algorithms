# NP-Completeness


### NP-Completeness
Lesson 1: Introduction to NP-Completeness
Video Lectures:
- Fundamentals of NP, P, and NP-Completeness, exploring the foundational concepts and significance in computational theory.
Exercises:
- Identify characteristics that classify problems as P, NP, or NP-Complete.
Programming Problem:
- Write pseudocode for non-deterministic algorithms for NP problems.

### Lesson 2: Reductions and NP-Hard
Video Lectures:
- Detailed examination of polynomial-time reductions and the concept of NP-Hardness, distinguishing it from NP-Completeness.
Exercises:
- Practice reductions between known NP-Complete problems.
Programming Problem:
- Implement a specific reduction to demonstrate NP-Hardness.

### Lesson 3: NP-Completeness Proofs
Video Lectures:
- Strategies for proving NP-Completeness, focusing on common techniques like reduction from known NP-Complete problems.
Exercises:
- Proving the NP-Completeness of new or less-common problems.
Programming Problem:
- Develop an algorithm to solve an NP-Complete problem and discuss its implications on computational tractability.

### Lesson 4: Understanding PSPACE
Video Lectures:
- Introduction to PSPACE, explaining the class of problems solvable in polynomial space.
Exercises:
- Conceptual problems to distinguish between P, NP, and PSPACE.
Programming Problem:
- Design an algorithm to solve a problem in PSPACE and analyze its space complexity.

### Lesson 5: Extending Tractability
Video Lectures:
- Explore methods to extend the tractability of problems, including approximation algorithms, fixed-parameter tractability, and heuristic approaches.
Exercises:
- Analyze problems to identify opportunities for making them tractable through these methods.
Programming Problem:
- Implement an approximation algorithm or heuristic approach for a traditionally intractable problem, discussing the trade-offs involved.
