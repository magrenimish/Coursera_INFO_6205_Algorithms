# Bear's Socks

Bear has embarked on a unique and seemingly simple yet surprisingly complex task: organizing his collection of 50 socks. These socks, after being washed and mixed together, need to be paired up again. However, the catch lies in the method Bear has chosen to tackle this: he selects socks blindly from the pile, adding an element of randomness to the task. This process is not just about finding pairs but also about understanding the intricacies of probability and strategy under constraints.

The complexity of Bear's challenge varies with the diversity of his sock collection. Specifically, the socks are categorized into different color groups, and the task's difficulty hinges on the number of these color categories: one, five, and ten. A scenario with just one color is trivial, as every sock matches every other. However, as the number of colors increases, the task transforms, introducing a fascinating blend of chance and strategy in the quest for matching pairs.

This problem is not just a matter of practical sock sorting; it's a peek into the world of combinatorial mathematics and probability theory. It challenges us to estimate the effort required to match all the socks under different scenarios, considering the changing dynamics as socks are gradually paired and removed from the equation. As we delve into this problem, we'll explore how the simplicity of sorting socks can unravel into a compelling puzzle that mirrors the unpredictability and complexity of real-life situations.

### A Random Approach

To solve this, we need to make some assumptions and calculate the expected number of pulls needed to get a matching pair for each scenario (1, 5, and 10 sock colors). Since the question doesn't specify how many socks of each color there are, let's assume the socks are evenly distributed across the colors. With 50 socks total:

- For 1 color, all 50 socks are of the same color, so matching pairs is trivial.
- For 5 colors, there are 10 socks of each color.
- For 10 colors, there are 5 socks of each color.

The scenario with 1 color doesn't really apply since every sock matches every other sock. For the scenarios with 5 and 10 colors, we can use probability to estimate how many pulls we might expect before finding all pairs.

For simplicity, let's calculate the expected pulls to match all socks for both 5 colors and 10 colors by considering the problem of drawing socks randomly and the chances of drawing a pair.

### Simplified Assumptions:
1. Each pull is independent.
2. Socks of the same color are indistinguishable from one another.
3. The process ends when all socks have been paired.

Given these assumptions, the calculation involves finding the expected number of draws to complete pairing, which is more complex due to the changing probabilities as socks are removed. 

However, a simplified approach can give us an intuitive understanding:
- **For a large number of colors relative to total socks**, it becomes more likely to draw unpaired socks, increasing the number of draws needed.
- **For a smaller number of colors**, fewer draws are generally needed to find a matching pair since the probability of drawing a sock of the same color increases.

A precise calculation would involve considering the probability distributions of drawing each successive sock, which is a more complex combinatorial problem. We can provide an approximate expectation by considering the decrease in the pool of unmatched socks as pairs are made.

Let's perform a simplified estimate for the 5 and 10 color scenarios to get a sense of how many pulls might be needed on average to pair all socks.

For scenarios with 5 and 10 sock colors, the simplified estimate yields the following approximate number of pulls to match all socks:

- With 5 colors, it would take approximately 4.2 pulls on average to match all socks.
- With 10 colors, it would take approximately 4.0 pulls on average to match all socks.

These results are counterintuitive and suggest a misunderstanding in the approach taken. The calculation intended to estimate the complexity of finding matching pairs under different scenarios seems to have mistakenly presented a much lower number of pulls than would realistically be needed to match all pairs in a scenario with multiple sock colors. 

In reality, the process of matching all socks, especially as the number of colors increases, involves significantly more pulls because:
1. Initially, when most socks are unmatched, the probability of pulling a matching pair is lower.
2. As more socks are matched, the probability of pulling a matching pair increases, but the overall process requires iterating through many non-matching pulls.

The correct interpretation should focus on understanding that matching all socks in scenarios with multiple colors involves navigating through the combinatorial challenge of pairing each sock, where the initial stages have a high likelihood of non-matching pulls, gradually improving as the process advances. 

The initial calculations do not accurately reflect the expected number of pulls to complete the pairing process for each scenario due to a misinterpretation in the approach. A more detailed combinatorial analysis would be required to accurately estimate the expected number of pulls, factoring in the changing probabilities as socks are matched and removed from the pool.

To determine how long it would take to match all of the socks given different numbers of sock colors, we can think about this problem in terms of probability and combinatorics. The time to match all socks depends on the probability of drawing a matching pair each time a sock is drawn from the pile. With more colors, it becomes statistically less likely to draw a matching pair quickly because there are more potential combinations. However, calculating the exact time requires making some assumptions about how often socks are drawn or defining a specific method for drawing and pairing socks.

For simplification, let's assume:
- You draw socks one at a time, at a constant rate, until you find a matching pair, then you set that pair aside and continue with the rest.
- "Time" is measured in terms of draws from the pile of socks until all are matched, not in actual time units like minutes or hours.

The number of draws needed to match all socks will depend on:
1. The total number of socks (50 in this case).
2. The number of colors (1, 5, and 10 scenarios).

### Scenario 1: 1 Color
If there is only 1 color of socks, every sock matches every other sock. Therefore, you would only need 50 draws to have all socks matched, with each draw successfully pairing with the previous one.

### Scenario 2: 5 Colors
If there are 5 colors, this means there are 10 socks of each color. The first match for each color will take, on average, more draws as you start with all colors mixed. As you draw more socks, the probability of drawing a matching pair increases. This scenario requires a more complex calculation to estimate the number of draws because the probability changes with each draw.

### Scenario 3: 10 Colors
With 10 colors, there are 5 socks of each color. Similar to the 5-color scenario, but with even more variability in the early draws and a higher initial probability of not finding a match. As socks are matched and removed, the probability of finding the remaining matches increases.

Let's calculate an approximation for scenarios 2 and 3 using a simplified model, understanding that the actual process involves changing probabilities with each draw. We'll calculate the expected number of draws to match all socks for the scenarios with 5 and 10 colors.

Based on the simplified assumptions:

- **Scenario 1 (1 Color):** It would take exactly 50 draws to match all of the socks, as every sock matches with every other sock.
- **Scenario 2 (5 Colors):** The estimated number of draws to match all socks is around 25. This estimate assumes that, on average, it takes about half the total socks of each color to find a matching pair. However, this simplification does not accurately reflect the changing probabilities after each draw, so the real number might be slightly different.
- **Scenario 3 (10 Colors):** Similarly, the estimated number of draws is also around 25, under the same assumptions as Scenario 2.

These estimates are very basic and assume that on average, you'll draw a matching pair within half the total socks for each color, which simplifies the changing dynamics of probabilities with each draw. In reality, the process involves more complex probability calculations, especially as the pool of unmatched socks decreases. However, these numbers provide a rough baseline for understanding how the number of colors impacts the process of matching socks.
